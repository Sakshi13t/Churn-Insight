# Churn Insight: Unveiling Customer Attrition Patterns

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer data, identify factors contributing to churn, and build predictive models that can help the company improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from a fictional telecommunications company and contains information about customer demographics, account details, and service usage. Key features include:

- `gender`
- `SeniorCitizen`
- `Partner`
- `Dependents`
- `tenure`
- `PhoneService`
- `MultipleLines`
- `InternetService`
- `OnlineSecurity`
- `OnlineBackup`
- `DeviceProtection`
- `TechSupport`
- `StreamingTV`
- `StreamingMovies`
- `Contract`
- `PaperlessBilling`
- `PaymentMethod`
- `MonthlyCharges`
- `TotalCharges`
- `Churn` (target variable)

## Data Exploration

- Initial analysis of the dataset was performed to understand the distribution of various features and their relationship with the target variable (Churn).
- Visualizations such as histograms and KDE plots were used to illustrate the distribution of features.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values and data encoding (one-hot encoding for categorical variables).
- Feature scaling using standardization or normalization techniques.
- Addressing class imbalance using oversampling techniques.

## Model Training

- Various machine learning models were trained, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Voting Classifier (ensemble of multiple models)

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using various metrics to assess their performance:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%. The confusion matrix and evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's ability to predict churn effectively.

## Future Work

- Explore more advanced techniques for feature selection and engineering.
- Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- Consider implementing a web application for real-time churn prediction

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
